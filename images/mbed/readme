Example for starting a server:
docker run -v cert-data:/cert/:ro,nocopy -it --rm mbedtls-1.3.11-server crt_file=/cert/rsa2048cert.pem key_file=/cert/rsa2048key.pem server_port=4433

The following versions are working:
- PolarSSL 1.2: >= 1.2.11
- PolarSSL 1.3: >= 1.3.4
- mbedTLS: >= 1.3.10 

PolarSSL under 1.2 does not include ssl_server2 application. It only includes ssl_server, which does not support parameters and only uses default keys.

The ssl_server2 has some problems to start in earlier versions:
- 1.3.0 - 1.3.3 
- 1.2.0 - 1.2.10

The example ssl_server2 application would need to be fixed. The server ends with:
```bash
  . Seeding the random number generator... ok
  . Loading the CA root certificate ... ok (0 skipped)
  . Loading the server cert. and key...
```
